# Sales-Analysis

In this Project I have use Python Pandas & Python Matplotlib to analyze and answer business questions about 12 months worth of sales data. The data contains hundreds of thousands of electronics store purchases broken down by month, product type, cost, purchase address, etc.

I started by cleaning data. Tasks performed is as follows:

* Drop NaN values from DataFrame
* Removing rows based on a condition
* Change the type of columns (to_numeric, to_datetime, astype)
* Once I have cleaned up our data a bit, wI move the data exploration section. 

In this section we explore 5 high level business questions related to our data:

1. What was the best month for sales? How much was earned that month?
2. What city sold the most product?
3. What time should we display advertisemens to maximize the likelihood of customerâ€™s buying product?
4. What products are most often sold together?
5. What product sold the most? Why do you think it sold the most?
